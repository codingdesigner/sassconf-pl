        &lt;div class=&quot;section-details--description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live style guides are widely accepted as a best practice in building user interfaces, but they don't always live up to their promise in practice. Meetup is a company with over 12 years of accumulated code, and we've been making a transition from ad-hoc UI to a more modern approach. We've learned a great deal about what works and what doesn't when trying to implement a custom CSS foundation and other design-driven tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll be going beyond the basic idea of a live style guide, demonstrating tools and techniques that can help design ideas thrive. Fully automated documentation, package management, cross-platform color management, authoring best practices, and the &lt;a href=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html'&gt;strangler pattern&lt;/a&gt; will be covered. This talk avoids diving deeply into advanced features of Sass, focusing instead on novel approaches to the process of building user interface. Let's get ready to use and create the front end development tools of the future! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All software referenced in this talk will be open source under the MIT License and available on github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
